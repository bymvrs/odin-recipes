            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, minced</li>
            <li>1 yellow or orange bell pepper, minced</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons freshly minced cilantro</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>10 empanada dough shells</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190° C with a rack in the center position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and bell peppers and cook,
                stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cilantro and cook, stirring, until
                fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, bouillon, tomato paste, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and 1 cup water. Bring to a
                simmer and cook, stirring often, until the liquid has mostly evaporated, but the mixture is not dry, 5-8
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Working with one dough shell at a time, add a heaping ⅓ cup of filling to one side of the dough, leaving
                a ¼ inch border around the edge.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Brush the egg wash on the dough edges,
                reserving the remaining egg wash, then fold the dough over the filling. Using a fork, firmly press the
                edges together to seal.</li>
            <li>Place the empanadas on the prepared sheet. Brush each with the remaining egg wash and then bake for 35
                minutes, or until golden browned.</li>
        </ol>
